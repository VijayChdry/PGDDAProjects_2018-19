--PROBLEM STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVE
--The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) has provided a dataset of trips made by the taxis in the New York City.The purpose of this dataset is to get a better understanding of the taxi system so that the city of New York can improve the efficiency of in-city commutes.Several exploratory questions can be ANSWERED about the travelling experience for passengers.

--Environment Setup: adding JAR file and setting parameters of Hive for partitioning
ADD JAR /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hive/lib/hive-hcatalog-core-1.1.0-cdh5.11.2.jar;
SET hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions=100000;
SET hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions.pernode=100000;

--BASIC DATA QUALITY CHECKS
--How many records has each TPEP provider provided? 
select vendorid , count(*) as n_records

--******************Exploratory data analysis to identify encountered unusual or erroneous rows in the dataset**************
-- PASSENGER_COUNT
select passenger_count,count(*) as n_passenger 
from nyc_taxi_ext_vj
group by passenger_count;
--CONCLUSION: I am assuming that in nyc taxi max 5 passenger plus one child so total 6 passengers are only allowed so other entries are considering to be erroneous.
--passenger count 0 has 108970 , 7 has 75, 8 has 60, 9 has 56 and 192 has 1
--filtering all of these wrong values from this column.

select * from nyc_taxi_ext_vj
WHERE trip_distance is NULL;
select * from nyc_taxi_ext_vj where trip_distance=0;
select count(*) as n_notrip from nyc_taxi_ext_vj where trip_distance=0;
--CONCLUSION: there is no NULL values and but some (120017) trip distances are 0 which needs to be filtered. 


--RATECODEID
select ratecodeid,count(*) as n_ratecode 
from nyc_taxi_ext_vj
group by ratecodeid;

--************Basic Data Quality Checks Summary*************
--You might have encountered unusual or erroneous rows in the dataset. Can you conclude which vendor is doing a bad job in providing the records using different columns of the dataset? 

select vendorid, count(*) as n_erroneousrecords
from nyc_taxi_ext_vj
where year(tpep_pickup_datetime) != 2017 OR (month(tpep_pickup_datetime) not in (11,12) or year(tpep_dropoff_datetime) != 2017
or month(tpep_dropoff_datetime) not in (11,12))
or passenger_count not in (1,2,3,4,5,6) or

--CONCLUSION: Vendor 2 (VefiFone Inc) is doing bad job in providing the records using different columns of the dataset. This vendor provides (5617248) erroneoud records which is higher in comparision to Venror1 records(4649325).
--1 As per above EDA analysis , this dataset has data for years other than 2017 and months other than Nov and Dec so it has been filtered according to problem statement.
--2 Passenger_count column has irrelevant values like 0, 192, 7,8,9 , As per myassumption in Nyc_Taxi the max passenger tey allowed is 6 including child seat. So i have filtered other values.
--3 trp_distance can't be <=0 so filtered the values accordingly.
--4 retecodeid coulmn also has irrelevant values so filtered accordingly. 
--5 As per data disctionary , removed irrelevant values from columns like extra, mta_tax, tip_amout, toll_amount, improvement_surcharge and total-amount. All the negative values are also removed from it.

--******************ANALYSIS 1************* 
--Q1: Compare the overall average fare per trip for November and December.

select round(avg(fare_amount), 2) as avg_farepertrip, mnth as monthoftheyear
from nyc_taxi_ext_partitioned_yr_mnth_orc_vj
group by mnth
order by mnth;
--CONCLUSION: Average fare in November is 12.91 and December is 12.75

--**comparision between Nov and Dec month using CASE function. 
select round(avg(CASE when mnth=11 then fare_amount else null end),2) as November_Average_Fare, 
round(avg(CASE when mnth=12 then fare_amount else null end),2)as December_Average_Fare,
round(100*((avg(CASE when mnth=11 then fare_amount else null end)-avg(CASE when mnth=12 then fare_amount else null end))/avg(CASE when mnth=12 then fare_amount else null end)),2) as Nov_Avg_pergreaterthan_Dec
from nyc_taxi_ext_partitioned_yr_mnth_orc_vj;
--CONCLUSION: Therefore the Average fare_charge recorded during November is -1.11% lesser than the average fare_charge recorded in December.Hence average fare is higher in the month of december.  



--Q2: Explore the ‘number of passengers per trip’ - how many trips are made by each level of ‘Passenger_count’? Do most people travel solo or with other people?

select passenger_count as n_passengers, count(*) as n_trips
from nyc_taxi_ext_partitioned_yr_mnth_orc_vj
group by passenger_count
order by passenger_count;

--***Comparision using CASE function by grouping the whole trips into solo and group and calculating there percentage share.

sum(CASE when passenger_count != 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)as Num_Group_Passenger_Trips,

from nyc_taxi_ext_partitioned_yr_mnth_orc_vj;
--CONCLUSION: People prefer to travel solo (70.89%) than with other people.



--Q3: Which is the most preferred mode of payment?

select payment_type as pay_mode, count(*) as n_trips
from nyc_taxi_ext_partitioned_yr_mnth_orc_vj
group by payment_type
order by n_trips desc;
--CONCLUSION: Credit card(12470546) is the most preferred mode of payment. then it is CASH which has (5914927).  



--Q4: What is the average tip paid per trip? Compare the average tip with the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles and comment whether the ‘average tip’ is a 
--representative statistic (of the central tendency) of ‘tip amount paid’. Hint: You may use percentile_approx(DOUBLE col, p): Returns an approximate pth percentile of a numeric 

--column (including floating point types) in the group.

from nyc_taxi_ext_partitioned_yr_mnth_orc_vj
where payment_type != 2;
--CONCLUSION: As it is clearly mentioned that payment type =2 (CASH) can not be accepted for tip_amount. 
--AVG_tip= 2.68 , 25th percentile = 1.32 , 50th percentile = 2 and 75th percentile = 3.05
--difference of Average tip paid and median (50th percentile) is equal to 0.68 that means average can't be central of tendency and we should use median as center of tendecy here. 



--Q5: Explore the ‘Extra’ (charge) variable - what fraction of total trips have an extra charge is levied?
select extra, count(*) as n_totaltrips
from nyc_taxi_ext_partitioned_yr_mnth_orc_vj
group by extra
order by extra;

--**comparision using CASE function to calculate percentage share of the trips between trips with extra charge and without wxtra charge.

sum(CASE when extra != 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)as Trips_with_extracharge, 
round(100*sum(CASE when extra != 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/count(*),3) as fraction_trips_with_extracharge
from nyc_taxi_ext_partitioned_yr_mnth_orc_vj;

--CONCLUSION: total trip without extracharge = 9956711 and with extracharge= 8527746.therefore 46.13% fraction of total trips are levied with extra charge. 




--*****************Analysis-II*************

--Q1: What is the correlation between the number of passengers on any given trip, and the tip paid per trip? Do multiple travellers tip more compared to solo travellers? 
--Hint: Use CORR(Col_1, Col_2)
-- Calculating correlations to understand passenger behavious between solo and groups. 
select round(corr(passenger_count, tip_amount),3) as cor_passenger_tipamnt,round(avg(CASE when passenger_count=1 then tip_amount else null end),3) as Solo_Avg_Tip,

from nyc_taxi_ext_partitioned_yr_mnth_orc_vj
where passenger_count !=2;

--CONCLUSION: the correlation between passenger and tip is -0.005 and it seems to be WEAK Negative correlation.
-- Average tip for solo is 1.833 and for group is 1.776 therefore solo gives more tip then group travellers. 



--Q2: Segregate the data into five segments of ‘tip paid’: [0-5), [5-10), [10-15) , [15-20) and >=20. Calculate the percentage share of each bucket (i.e. the fraction of trips falling in each bucket).
--Creating bucketing for tip_amount

--Q3: Which month has a greater average ‘speed’ - November or December? Note that the variable ‘speed’ will have to be derived from other metrics. Hint: You have columns for distance and time.
